# Perceptron Notes.
OK so I have mostly implemented the perceptron as per the wikipedia page.
However, the wikipedia page pulled a fast one on me by changing the learning algorithm
to not incorporate the bias (instead forcing the first row of the weight matrix to be 1
as an improvised bias). 
I will take a look at https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-perceptron-algorithm-scratch-python/
Here is the sonar data set for the perceptron training.
